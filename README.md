*Posts are hardcoded. No such feature in backend yet.

### Dialogs page

- User switching
- User-friendly chat interface especially for mobile
- I don't know what can I say - just look at it couse it's awesome :)
*Dialogs and messages are hardcoded. No such feature in backend yet.

### Users page
- Pagination with url params
- Lazy-loading by scrolling down
- Follow/unfollow functions if authorized
- Also you can send message to this user if authorized. It will trow you to dialogs page with users id in URL and if you'll send a message this user will be in your dialogs list

### Login page

Also, this site is adaptive for mobile and desktop, have (i hope) a nice code structure and was written in compliance with the rules of clean code. Have a nice day! :)
